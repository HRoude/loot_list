Want-It is a personalized wish list for users. Users may give other permission to view their wish list and may form groups of friends or family that may view every group member's list.

This application differs from other wish lists out there, as it includes personalized information including hobbies, charities, favorite vacation ideas and sports; what the user wants; and what the user absolutely does not want or dislikes.
