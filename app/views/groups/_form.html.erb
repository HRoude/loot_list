				Feel free to create your own personal Loot-List group and then add your friends or family.  When you add someone, then they can view everyone's Loot-Lists that are in the group.  <br><br>

			<p>
				Only the group members may view each other's lists. <br><br>

				Even if you think there is absolutely nothing you could possibly want to receive as a gift, just giving your friends and family a few hints and suggestions for gifts will get you the PERFECT LOOT! <br><br>
